Programming languages project: rewrite DiskUsage Android app

## About project
This project was written for acquaintance with mobile development based on Kotlin & Jetpack Compose. For that purpose, I've picked my favourite Android application, and tried to upgrade it. Fortunately, this application was written in early 2010, so it turns to be possible. Subsequently I realized that Compose canvas & software render may be very slow, so I'm thinking about adding some OpenGL, but that is beyond the scope of this programming languages project.
